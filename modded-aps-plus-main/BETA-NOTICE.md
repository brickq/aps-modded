# What you need to know

This is an open beta build of an advanced private server template for Arras.io, independent from the official client. If you're familiar with `arras-template`, you'll be familiar with this.

This is **not** representative of the final product.

Some things may not either be present or work correctly:

- Healer branch tanks
- Certain types of Rare Polygons (Albino, Epilepsy, Trans)
- Tyr, Fiolnir, Ragnarok, Kronos, Legionary Crasher, Diep Bosses
- Camera zooming
- Most Arms Race tanks
- Shoot on Death

Some custom tanks are available to play around with, but I don't know if they'll be included in the final version.

- Most of these are either ported from Woomy-Arras, made up by someone else, or are older tanks not included in Retrograde or Arms Race.

Some limitations exist, mostly due to unpatched bugs:

- Adding a Tier 4 upgrade to a Tier 2 or Tier 1 tank breaks the upgrade tree.
  - Proposed explanation: Likely due to the upgrade tree not being used to handling Tier 4 tanks?
