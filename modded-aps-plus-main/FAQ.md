## Frequently Asked Questions

### My server isn't updating when I make changes to the code!

Make sure that you've changed the "`aps-template`" to your glitch project's name, it should be in the top-left corner above "Settings".

If you're still having issues, or that wasn't the cause of the problem, blame Glitch.

### Something weird happened and the screen's going funky!

Something's wrong with the code. Check the files for errors and try again, or undo some recent changes.
